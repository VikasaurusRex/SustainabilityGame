# Sustainability Game using Arduino and Processing

## Introduction

> There are 4 switches led into an Arduino. The Arduino portion of the repository reads the switches and prints them over Serial communication to the Processing portion of the repository, where the values are read in and analyzed for the current button positions. Once the correct configuration is met, the game will move onto the next level with another challenge.


## Installation

> If you plan to run this, have 4 switches into an Arduino and hooked up to a computer via Serial (USB). Run the Arduino first, then the Processing to play the game. Have the wiring detailed like the Arduino code says it should. You will have switches for different methods of energy generation and one switch to determine whether the energy grid is storing or distributing power.
